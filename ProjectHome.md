# phpMyReservation #

phpMyReservation is a web-based reservation system. It's based on HTML5, PHP & MySQL, and it's free and open source.

It was originally written to replace the paper-based reservation system used to reserve a washing machine used by many people where I live. Since it has other potential uses, and can be useful to others, I decided to make it available here.

In addition to reserving a washing machine, it can for example be used to reserve a tennis court, a conference/meeting room etc. It is not intented to be used in situations where high security, high reliability or being able to handle hundreds of users is required.

**[phpMyReservation 1.0 is now available for download](http://www.olejon.net/code/phpmyreservation/?download_page)**

**Many are contacting me regarding a new version. As of now I can not guarantee a new version in the near future. I will keep all your suggestions in mind if I start working on a new version. I am aware of that the current version have some bugs & flaws. As I have no education in technology whatsoever, I learn how to code in my spare time. With my knowledge today, I am aware of the fact that the code could be better. Test it thoroughly to see if it works for you.**

**Thanks for all your nice feedback!**
